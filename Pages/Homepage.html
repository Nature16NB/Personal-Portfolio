    <h1> Nisarg Bhatt's Portfolio</h1>
    <p> Welcome to my portfolio! This website was made just to practice my code and to create a better
        online presence in the world. I think that it would come to use when people try to search me on the
        Internet when I am trying to get a job. So, I will be working on this till I no longer need it. 
        Enjoy browsing around :)
